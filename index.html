        <p>
            Originally, track and field was used in ancient civilizations in parts of religious festivals, military training and cultural celebrations.
            The earliest recorded evidence of track and field dates back to around 776 BCE where the ancient Olympic games were held in Olympia.
            The ancient Olympic Games were very prestigious and attracted people from all over the area.
            However, the Olympic Games fell with the Roman Empire and were abolished in 393 CE. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Renaissance period showed a increase of interest in track and field as they were fascinated by the ancient world.
            The renewed interest, was the initial spark that helped start the modern Olympic movement, and with that, modern track and field. 
            However it wasn't until the 1800's that we see track and field as we know it today, because that is when standardized rules were made for the sport.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1896, The modern Olympic Games were initiated and played a massive role in the global recognition and promotion of track and field. 
            Then, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) was founded in 1912 to govern international track and field competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, track and field remains a big part of the Olympic Games and other international competitions. 
            As athletes from around the world participate in a diverse array of events, showcasing their speed, strength, and skill, 
            the sport continues to captivate audiences globally, celebrating both individual excellence and the spirit of competition.
