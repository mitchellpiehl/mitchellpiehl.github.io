History of Artificial Intelligence website

This website was built and designed for a new course called Foundations and History of Artificial Intelligence which is being introduced in the fall of 2025 as a part of the Masters of Arts in Artificial Intelligence Leadership program. 

The main component of this website is the interactive timeline in which users can view the important events that led to Artificial Intelligence as we know it today in a interactive manner. It allows users to zoom out and see only the most important events, then zoom in to see more events and more details about each event, as well as being able to click on and through the events to see even more information, with pictures and links. 

Other pages including the important people in the development of AI, important papers, suggested further readings for students and learners, online resources to learn more about various topics, and a glossary that describes all the most important concepts in AI.

All the content for this website is not embedded within the HTML but rather on google sheets to allow for easy editing throughout the semester. Javascript is used to pull the content from the google sheets and display it on the timeline and in the pages in a presentable manner.

There are many other features of this website that include mobile phone compatibility, easy modifications and additions to content and a user friendly design to make it easy to learn the course content.
